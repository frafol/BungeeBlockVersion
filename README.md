A Bungee/Waterfall plugin that will block players from connecting with certain versions.
## Features
- Block players if they are using a version that is on the list.
- Custom disconnect message.
- Reload using `/bbvreload`. (bbv.reload)

## Config
This is the config. You need to use the version number for a version. To find them, go [here](https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers).
```yaml
# These versions will NOT be allowed to connect.
# These versions MUST be the version number. You can check the numbers here: https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers
# By default, all versions are listed here.
versions:
  - 47
  - 107
  - 108
  - 109
  - 110
  - ...

# Send this message if someone connects with a blocked version.
# Use {VERSIONS} to show what versions your server uses. It will display like "1.8 to 1.16.3" or whatever.
# If you don't want to use {VERSIONS}, just remove it.
disconnect-message: "&cYou cannot connect with this version! We only allow version(s) {VERSIONS}."

# No touch please :)
config-version: 1
